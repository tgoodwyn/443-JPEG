The script in this folder shows the evolution of the first 8x8 block in color, and outputs the first 8x8 block and image at every stage in color.

The revised script in "Intermediate code generation/Matlab folder" omits the display function and instead outputs only the Y channel of the first 8x8 block at every stage
in addition to the full color image. It also outputs the Y channel of the first 8x8 block at every stage as a text document.
